// - **Dynamic Reports**: Enable users to generate custom reports and visualizations based on selected criteria.

// ### Example Dashboard Layout

// 1. **Top Section**: Overview of skills distribution and proficiency levels (e.g., pie chart and heatmap).
// 2. **Middle Section**: Skill gaps and training needs (e.g., gap analysis chart and progress bars).
// 3. **Bottom Section**: Team composition and career development insights (e.g., radar chart and career path diagram).

// ### Summary

// Effective dashboards for skill data should use a combination of visualizations to provide a comprehensive view of skills across employees, teams, and roles. The choice of visualizations should align with the specific insights you want to derive, such as skill distribution, proficiency levels, skill gaps, and training needs. Interactive and dynamic elements can enhance the usability and depth of the dashboard.
//

// If the skills are specific to designations (roles or job titles) within your organization, you can tailor the dashboard visualizations to reflect this relationship. Hereâ€™s how you can create effective visualizations in a dashboard that reflect the association between skills and designations:

// ### 1. **Skills per Designation**

// - **Bar Chart**: Display the number of skills required for each designation. Each bar represents a designation,
// and the height represents the number of skills associated with it.
// - **Pie Chart**: Show the distribution of skills across different designations.
// Each slice represents a designation, with the size proportional to the number of skills associated with it.

// ### 2. **Skill Requirements per Designation**

// - **Radar Chart (Spider Chart)**: Visualize the skill requirements for each designation. Each axis represents a skill, and the shape outlines the skills required for a particular designation.
// - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Show how different skills are required across various designations. Each bar represents a designation, and the segments within the bar represent different skills.

// ### 3. **Skill Proficiency by Designation**

// - **Heatmap**: Illustrate the proficiency levels of skills for each designation. Colors indicate the level of proficiency, making it easy to spot strengths and weaknesses.
// - **Grouped Bar Chart**: Display skill proficiency levels for each designation. Each group of bars represents a designation, and each bar within the group represents a different skill.

// ### 4. **Skill Gaps for Designations**

// - **Gap Analysis Chart**: Compare the skills required for each designation with the skills that employees in those designations currently have. This can be displayed as a bar chart showing the gap for each skill.
// - **Bubble Chart**: Show skill gaps for different designations, where each bubble represents a designation, the size of the bubble represents the gap size, and the color represents proficiency.

// ### 5. **Training Needs for Designations**

// - **Progress Bars**: Track the progress of employees in gaining the required skills for specific designations. Each progress bar represents a skill and shows how close employees are to meeting the requirements.
// - **Timeline Chart**: Display the progress of skill acquisition over time for each designation. This helps in understanding how skill levels are evolving.

// ### 6. **Skill Distribution Across Designations**

// - **Treemap**: Visualize the hierarchical relationship between designations and skills. Each block represents a designation, with sub-blocks showing the skills associated with it.
// - **Sunburst Chart**: Show the hierarchical structure of designations and their associated skills. The center represents the root, and the layers outward represent designations and skills.

// ### 7. **Career Development and Promotion**

// - **Career Path Diagram**: Map out the skills required for advancing from one designation to another. This helps employees see the path for career progression based on skill acquisition.
// - **Competency Matrix**: Compare the competencies required for different designations and visualize how employees meet these requirements.

// ### 8. **Skill Utilization by Designation**

// - **Column Chart**: Show how often specific skills are utilized in each designation. Each column represents a designation, and the height represents the frequency or importance of the skill.
// - **Network Diagram**: Visualize the connections between designations and skills, showing how skills are distributed and utilized across different roles.

// ### Example Dashboard Layout

// 1. **Top Section**: Overview of skills required by each designation (e.g., bar chart and pie chart).
// 2. **Middle Section**: Skill proficiency and gaps for each designation (e.g., heatmap and gap analysis chart).
// 3. **Bottom Section**: Training needs and career development (e.g., progress bars and career path diagram).

// ### Implementation Example

// **1. Skills per Designation**

// ```javascript
// const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
// const prisma = new PrismaClient();

// async function getSkillsPerDesignation() {
//   const designations = await prisma.designation.findMany({
//     include: {
//       Skills: true, // Include associated Skills
//     },
//   });

//   const skillsPerDesignation = designations.map(designation => ({
//     designation: designation.name,
//     skillCount: designation.Skills.length,
//   }));

//   console.log(skillsPerDesignation);
// }

// getSkillsPerDesignation();
// ```

// **2. Skill Requirements per Designation**

// ```javascript
// async function getSkillRequirements() {
//   const designations = await prisma.designation.findMany({
//     include: {
//       Skills: true,
//     },
//   });

//   // Map the data for visualization (e.g., radar chart)
//   const skillRequirements = designations.map(designation => ({
//     designation: designation.name,
//     skills: designation.Skills.map(skill => skill.name),
//   }));

//   console.log(skillRequirements);
// }

// getSkillRequirements();
// ```

// ### Summary

// For a dashboard focusing on skills specific to designations:
// - Use visualizations that show the relationship between skills and designations.
// - Include charts and graphs that reflect the requirements, proficiency levels, gaps, and distribution of skills across designations.
// - Interactive elements can help users filter by designation or skill and explore detailed insights.
